    Blood banking is the process that takes place in the lab to make 
    sure that donated blood, or blood products, are safe before they 
    are used in blood transfusions and other medical procedures. 
    Blood banking includes typing 
    the blood for transfusion and testing for infectious diseases.
A blood bank is a center where blood gathered 
as a result of blood donation is stored and 
preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term "blood bank" 
typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs
 and where proper testing is performed (to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events). 
 However, it sometimes refers to a collection center, and some hospitals also perform collection. 
 Blood banking includes 
tasks related to blood collection, processing, testing, separation, and storage.
