<center><h1>Blood Bank</h1></center>

The Ethiopian National Blood Bank collects nearly 200,000 units of blood from donors annually, which is an equivalent of 200,000 pints/94,000 litres. The country requires 18,000 units of blood (18,000 pints/8,460 litres) daily, yet the average daily amount collected is approximately 1,100 units (1,100 pints/517 litres) â€“ a shortfall of 16,900 pints/7943 litres. 
 
With each unit of blood donated being able to be divided into three primary components (red blood cells, plasma, and platelets), potentially saving up to three lives.
A blood bank is a place where blood is collected and stored before it is used for transfusions. Blood banking takes place in the lab. This is to make sure thet donated blood and blood products are safe before they are used. Blood banking also determines the blood type. The blood is also tested for infectious diseases.

According to the American Red Cross:

About 36,000 units of blood are needed every day.

The number of blood units donated is about 13.6 million a year.

About 6.8 million volunteers are blood donors each year.

Each unit of blood is broken down into components. These are red blood cells, plasma, cryoprecipitated AHF (cryo), a white blood cell called a granulocyte, and platelets. One unit of whole blood and its parts may be transfused to several people. Each person may have a different need.

More than 21 million blood components are transfused each year.</p>
